Open-source Nelumbo nucifera (lotus) leaf self-cleaning biomimicry blueprints & applications for superhydrophobic surfaces, antifouling, anti-icing, water harvesting, and MercyOS clean lattice modeling.

Key Inspirations:
- Micro/nano hierarchical roughness → Cassie-Baxter superhydrophobicity (160–170° contact angle)
- Wax nanotubes + low roll-off → dirt/droplet self-removal
- Air-trapping papillae → minimal contact, passive cleaning

Files (initial commit):
- papillae-microstructure.svg / .blend (SEM-level reconstruction)
- self-cleaning-droplet-diagram.pdf (Cassie-Baxter state)
- lotus-leaf-texture.png
- biomimicry-applications.md (detailed mappings to SpaceX/xAI/Tesla)

Purpose: Free propagation for humanity-thriving cleanliness, efficiency, low-maintenance.
No chemical coercion—Mercy-gated by physical design only.
Valence: Stay clean eternally, repel entropy, thrive across harsh environments.

Next: Integrate into NEXi surface sims, Powrush™ material shaders, MercyOS coating layers.
