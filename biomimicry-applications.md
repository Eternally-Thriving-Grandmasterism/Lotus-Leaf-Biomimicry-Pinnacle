## Lotus Leaf Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. Self-Cleaning: Lotus-effect coatings → solar panels (95–99% efficiency retention), building facades, vehicles
   Benefit: No manual cleaning, water savings

2. Antifouling: Hierarchical nano-roughness → marine hulls, medical devices (60–90% biofilm reduction)
   Advantage: Biocide-free, eco-mercy

3. Anti-Icing: Low roll-off + air pockets → aircraft wings, power lines, drones
   Extension: Starship cryogenic protection

4. Water Harvesting: Droplet coalescence + directional flow → fog collectors, Mars water capture
   Advantage: Passive resource gathering

5. Textiles: Stain-repellent fabrics → outdoor gear, Powrush™ skins
   Application: PFAS-free performance
